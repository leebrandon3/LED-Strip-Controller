The LED Strip is connected to an NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller which is able to connected to the internet. Code for the ESP8266 was developed using the ArduinoIDE. As well as the ESP8266WiFi.h library. The LED Strip can be controlled as long as the LED Strip and the user are within the same network.
